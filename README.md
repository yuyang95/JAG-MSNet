**Usage**

Run MSNet_samson.py

If you want to run the code in your own data, you can accordingly change the input and change the parameters.

The format of input:

A represents the ground truth of abundance.

M represents the ground truth of endmembers.

M1 represents the initialization of endmembers by VCA.

Y represents the HSI.
